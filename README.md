# Linear-Search-Algorithm
This is a Linear Search Algorithm that can be analyzed using the master theorem. It is done recursively and takes in data from the standard input file, the input is formatted as such: 
The first line indicates the number of entries as a base-10 integer.
The next n lines are base-10 integers (32-bit) that are not sorted.
The last line is a base-10 integer k.
K is what you want to search for.
This fits the first case of the master theorem.

to use .txt file as input, use redirection 
./main < example.txt
